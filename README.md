# LoRa SX127x and Pico Communicator

### This project is not currently functioning

## Overview

This project implements a LoRa communication system using the SX127x module and Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. The project enables long-range, low-power communication between devices, making it suitable for various IoT and sensor network applications but in this case it is used as a text-based walkie talkie.

## Features

- LoRa communication using Semtech SX127x transceiver module.
- Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller-based solution.
- Two-way communication between devices.
- Simple data transmission and reception.

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico.
- LoRa SX127x module (e.g., RA-02).
- ILI9341 TFT screen
